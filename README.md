Project to test grapqhl frontend and backend based on example from university

Unfortunately when cloning the repo to a local one via Visual Studio, another wrapper parent category is created around it. Visual Studio opens directly that one and the application does not run, because package-lock.json cannot be located. 

To run properly you need to open the folder within the local repo in Visual Studio and the project will run without any problems.
